    <h1>Barley and Red Lentil Curry with Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../img/curry.jpg">
    <br>
    <p>Chicken, Barley & Red Lentil Curry is a rich, soul-warming dish that strikes the perfect balance between comfort food and bold flavor. Tender chunks of chicken simmer in a fragrant blend of curry spices, garlic, and ginger, nestled into a creamy base of nutty pearl barley and soft red lentils that practically melt into the sauce. And the best part? It all comes together in the pressure cooker—just a quick sauté to build flavor, then you seal the lid, walk away, and let the magic happen in under 30 minutes. Each spoonful is thick, hearty, and infused with warm aromatics—like your favorite takeout, but more satisfying and deeply homemade. Finished with a splash of coconut milk for just the right touch of silkiness, this one-pot wonder is both nourishing and craveable. Serve it up with fresh herbs, warm flatbread, or just a big spoon—it’s the kind of dish that hugs you back.</p>
