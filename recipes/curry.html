    <h1>Barley and Red Lentil Curry with Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../img/curry.jpg">
    <br>
    <p>Chicken, Barley & Red Lentil Curry is a rich, soul-warming dish that strikes the perfect balance between comfort food and bold flavor.<br>
         Tender chunks of chicken simmer in a fragrant blend of curry spices, garlic, and ginger, nestled into a creamy base of nutty pearl barley <br> 
         and soft red lentils that practically melt into the sauce. Each spoonful is thick, hearty, and infused with warm aromatics—like your favorite takeout,<br>
          but more satisfying and deeply homemade. Finished with a splash of coconut milk for just the right touch of silkiness,this one-pot wonder is both <br>
          nourishing and craveable. Serve it up with fresh herbs, warm flatbread, or just a big spoon—it’s the kind of dish that hugs you back. </p>
